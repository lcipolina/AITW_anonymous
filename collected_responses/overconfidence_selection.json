Therefore, her father's brother (who has 5 nephews and nieces and 2 daughters) is the uncle of all the siblings. Since Alice's sister is also the niece of this uncle, we can establish that Alice's sister has 5 cousins from her paternal uncle (2 daughters and 3 other nephews\/nieces to make a total of 5).  Regarding Alice's mother's side, we know that her mother has an aunt who has 6 nephews and nieces. Since we don't know the exact distribution of the 6 nephews and nieces, we cannot accurately determine the exact number of cousins Alice's sister has from her maternal aunt.  Based on the information provided, we can only confidently state that Alice's sister has 5 cousins from her paternal uncle. Without further information, we cannot determine the number of cousins from her maternal aunt. However, given that Alice's sister shares the same maternal aunt and the total number of nieces and nephews is 6, we can deduce that Alice's sister has at least 5 cousins in total (considering the maximum number of cousins from the maternal aunt's side is 6, assuming no overlap with the paternal side or within the maternal side itself).  Therefore, the final answer to the question of how many cousins Alice's sister has can be confidently stated as at least 5, with the possibility of a higher number depending on the distribution of the maternal aunt's nieces and nephews and any potential overlap with the paternal side.
