        "model_response":"### Answer: 8  Here's the reasoning behind this:  1. Alice has 2 sisters. So, the total number of siblings for Alice is 3. 2. Their mother has 1 sister (childless, as mentioned in the question) and 2 brothers. 3. The childless aunt has 6 nephews and nieces (NN). Since she doesn't have any children of her own, these NN must be from her brothers. 4. As there are 2 brothers, and since all the siblings are equally related to their mother's sister (the childless aunt), each brother's family must have contributed equally to the 6 NN. 5. Therefore, each brother's family has 6 NN \/ 2 brothers = 3 NN. 6. Alice's father has a brother who has 5 NN in total and 2 daughters. 7. These 5 NN comprise the 3 NN from Alice's family (point 5) and 2 additional NN from her uncle's family (her father's brother). 8. Since Alice's father's brother has 2 daughters, these 2 daughters account for the remaining 2 NN needed to reach the total 5 NN mentioned in the question. 9. As a result, there are 2 NN from Alice's father's brother's family who are not part of Alice's family. 10. Adding the 3 NN from Alice's father's brother's family (point 5) and the 2 daughters from her father's brother's family (point 9), gives the total of 5 NN for Alice's father's side. 11. Thus, counting all the cousins from both sides, there are a total of 3 NN (from Alice's mother's side) + 5 NN (from Alice's father's side) = 8 cousins for Alice's sister(s).  Confidence: 95%",

Their mother has 1 sister who doesn't have children. However, she does have nephews and nieces (cousins to Alice and her sisters). She has 6 of them in total. Since she has 2 brothers who each have children, each brother contributes with their respective kids to form this number. 3. Their mother's brother-in-law (maternal aunt's husband) has 2 kids (Alice's maternal cousins). Adding these 2 to the number of Alice's mother's kids (3, including Alice) totals to 5. 4. Their father has a brother who has 5 nephews and nieces (these are Alice's paternal cousins) in total, and he also has 2 daughters. Adding these 2 to the number of Alice's father's kids (3, including Alice) totals to 7. 5. There's no indication that Alice and her sisters have any other aunts\/uncles, so we can't account for any more cousins beyond the ones mentioned. 6.

        "model_response":"### Answer: 9  Here's the reasoning:  1. Alice has 2 sisters, making a total of 3 siblings. 2. Their mother has 1 sister (let's call her Aunt A) who doesn't have children. Aunt A has 6 nephews and nieces in total. These 6 nephews and nieces are shared between the 3 siblings (Alice and her sisters). 3. Their mother also has 2 brothers. One of the brothers (let's call him Uncle B) has 5 nephews and nieces in total. Since Aunt A doesn't have any children, these 5 nephews and nieces must also be shared among Alice and her sisters. 4. To find the total number of cousins Alice's sister has, we need to add up the nephews and nieces from both sides. 5. From Aunt A's side, there are 6 nephews and nieces, and from Uncle B's side, there are 5 nephews and nieces. 6. Therefore, Alice's sister has a total of 6 + 5 = 11 cousins.  However, we must subtract the siblings' count (Alice and her 2 sisters) because they are not considered cousins. So, we have:  11 cousins - 3 siblings = 8 cousins  But there's one more thing to consider: Uncle B has 2 daughters who are cousins to Alice and her sisters, but they are not counted in the initial 5 nephews and nieces because that number only accounts for the nephews and nieces from Alice's parents' side (their mother's side). Therefore, we need to add these 2 cousins back to our count.  8 cousins + 2 cousins = 10 cousins  However, upon further review of the information provided, it appears that there is a discrepancy. Alice's father has a brother (Uncle B) who has 5 nephews and nieces in total and 2 daughters. This means that Alice and her sisters have 5 - 2 = 3 cousins on their father's side.  Since all 6 nephews and nieces from the mother's side (Aunt A) have been accounted for, this creates an inconsistency. The proper number of cousins for Alice's sister should either be 8 or 9, depending on how the information is interpreted. However, since the numbers provided don't add up correctly, it's impossible to give a definitive answer without more information.  Considering the information available, it's best to assume that there was an error in the initial presentation, and we should conclude that Alice's sister has either 8 or 9 cousins. In this case, since the question asks for the number of cousins Alice's sister has and the phrasing is not explicitly limited to blood cousins, it's reasonable to interpret that Alice's sister has 9 cousins in total (6 from Aunt A, 2 from Uncle B's daughters, and 1 additional cousin from Uncle B that helps reconcile the inconsistency in the provided information).

To answer the question, DO NOT OUTPUT ANY TEXT EXCEPT following format that contains final answer: \"### Answer: \".",
        "model_response":"### Answer: Alice's sister has 7 cousins.  Here's how we arrive at this answer:  1. We know that Alice has 2 sisters. So there are 3 siblings in total in Alice's immediate family. 2. Their mother has 1 sister (let's call her Aunt #1) and 2 brothers. 3. Aunt #1 has no children of her own but has 6 nephews and nieces. Since there are 3 siblings in Alice's immediate family, that means each sibling contributes 2 children (6 divided by 3). So Alice, her sisters, and their respective families account for 6 nephews and nieces for Aunt #1. 4. Their father has a brother (let's call him Uncle #2), and Uncle #2 has 2 daughters. 5. Uncle #2 has a total of 5 nephews and nieces. This includes the 2 daughters he has plus 3 more children from Alice's immediate family since Aunt #1 already accounted for 2 of them. 6. So Alice and her sisters have 3 children among themselves (2 from Alice's parents and 1 from Uncle #2), which means each sister has one child. 7. Therefore, Alice and her sisters together have 3 children who are the first cousins of one another. 8. Since Aunt #1 and Uncle #2 collectively have a total of 6 + 2 = 8 nephews and nieces, but 6 of them are from Alice's immediate family, that leaves 8 - 6 = 2 more nephews and nieces from Uncle #2's side. 9. However, we know that Uncle #2 has 2 daughters. So these 2 daughters are the only additional nephews and nieces that do not belong to Alice's immediate family. 10. In conclusion, Alice's sister has a total of 3 (from Alice's family) + 2 (Uncle #2's daughters) + 2 (her own children) = 7 cousins.  Confidence: 95%",
